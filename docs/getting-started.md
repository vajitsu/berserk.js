# Getting Started

> 🏗️ The `app` directory is currently in beta and is subject to change at any given time

## Creating a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) 
2. Click on the `New Application` button
3. Fill out the popup, then click "Create"

Now that a Discord application has been initialized, we need to create a Discord bot.

1. Select the `Bot` tab on the sidebar
2. Click the `Add Bot` and select the confirmation button in the popup

The token should now appear under the username input area

> **Never** share the token with anybody

If you have already created a `jujutsu.config.js`, add the token to the `discord.token` property
