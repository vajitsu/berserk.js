This is a [Berserk.js](https://vajitsu.com/berserk/) project bootstrapped with [`create-berserk-app`](https://github.com/vercel/berserk.js/tree/canary/packages/create-berserk-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open a Discord channel that your bot is inside in and run `/hello`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/hello/command.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
