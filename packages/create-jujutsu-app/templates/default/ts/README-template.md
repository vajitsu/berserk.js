This is a [Jujutsu.js](https://vajitsu.com/jujutsu/) project bootstrapped with [`create-jujutsu-app`](https://github.com/vercel/jujutsu.js/tree/canary/packages/create-jujutsu-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open a Discord channel that your bot is inside in and run `/hello`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `commands/hello.ts`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
