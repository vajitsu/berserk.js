# Initial files

Once you [add your bot to a server](/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.md), the next step is to start coding and get it online! Let's start by creating a config file for your client token and a main file for your bot application.

## Creating configuration files

As explained in the ["What is a token, anyway?"](/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.md#what-is-a-token-anyway) section, your token is essentially your bot's password, and you should protect it as best as possible. This can be done through a _`config.json`_ file or by using environment variables.

Open your application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and go to the "Bot" page to copy your token.

### Using config.json

Storing data in a _`config.json`_ file is a common way of keeping your sensitive values safe. Create a _`config.json`_ file in your project directory and paste in your token. You can access your token inside other files by using _`require()`_.

<CH.Code client:load>

```json config.json
{
  "token": "your-token-goes-here"
}
```

---

```js Usage
const { token } = require("./config.json");
console.log(token);
```

</CH.Code>
